A compressed bitset structure in C. The compression technique
is described briefly
[here](https://github.com/chriso/bitset/blob/master/include/bitset.h#L7-19)
and is described in full in [this
paper](http://alpha.uhasselt.be/icdt/edbticdt2010proc/edbt/papers/p0228-Deliege.pdf).

I've released this under the `GPLv3` license for now. Contact me if you
want a more permissive license.

Have a look at at the [node.js
bindings](https://github.com/chriso/node-bitset) for an example of the
usage and supported operations.
