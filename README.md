**A compressed bitset structure in C.**

I've released this under the `GPLv3` license for now. Contact me if you
want a more permissive license.

The compression technique
is described briefly
[here](https://github.com/chriso/bitset/blob/master/include/bitset.h#L8-23)
and is very similar to the technique described in [this
paper](http://alpha.uhasselt.be/icdt/edbticdt2010proc/edbt/papers/p0228-Deliege.pdf). Have a look at at [header
file](https://github.com/chriso/bitset/blob/master/include/bitset.h) or the [node.js
bindings](https://github.com/chriso/node-bitset) for an example of the
usage and supported operations.
