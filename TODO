Rewrite tests that hardcode words to use BITSET_ macros
Remove the (C)olour bit and add an extra (L)ength bit
Encode lengths > 2^26 using a fill with P=0 followed by another. Length is L1 << 26 & L2
Use builtin ffs(), fls(), POPCNT if available
Implement probabilistic HyperLogLog and Top-k algorithms for streams of bitsets
Ensure const-correctness
Consider merging bitset_hash_* and bitset_vector_hash_* using macros/void*
Consider renaming the "bitset" type to prevent keyword conflicts
